       <strong><p>An ETF is a collection of securities that are traded on the stock
         exchange. These securities could be stocks, commodities, bonds or
          currencies. As they are listed on an exchange, ETFs trade like stocks
           and experience price changes as and when they are bought and sold. 
           Assume a fund that has all the Sensex 30 stocks. Let’s call it the 
           Sensex Fund. This fund, with its basket of 30 stocks, gives you the 
           advantage of risk diversification. Trading in an ETF is just like buying
            or selling the Sensex Fund or any other Index Fund listed on the stock exchange. 
            Since the Sensex Fund trades like a stock, its price fluctuates during market hours.</p></strong>

       <strong> <p>Initial margin is defined as a percentage of your open position
             and is set for different positions by the exchange or clearing
              house. The factors that decide the amount of initial margin are
               the average volatility of the stock in concern over a specified
                period of time and the interest cost. Initial margin amounts 
                fluctuate daily depending on the market value of your open positions.
                 Mark-to-Market margin covers the difference between the cost of the
                  contract and its closing price on the day the contract is purchased.
                   Post purchase, MTM margin covers the daily differences in closing prices.</p></strong>

        asset eventually. The buyer in an options contract has to pay a premium.
         The payment of this premium grants the options buyer the privilege to 
         not buy the asset on a future date if it becomes less attractive. Should
          the options contract holder choose not to buy the asset, the premium paid
           is the amount he stands to lose. In both cases, you may have to pay certain commissions.</p></stroong>

       <strong><p>To start trading in Futures and Options(F&O), all you
         need to do is open an online trading account. When you 
         buy in the cash segment, you have to pay the entire value 
         of the shares purchased – this is unless you are a day trader 
         utilizing margin trading. You have to pay this amount upfront 
         to the exchange or the clearing house. This upfront payment is 
         called ‘Margin Money’. It helps reduce the risk that the exchange
          undertakes and helps in maintaining the integrity of the market. 
          Once you have these requisites, you can buy a Futures and Options(F&O)
           contract. Simply place an order with your broker, specifying the 
           details of the contract like the Scrip, expiry month, contract size, 
           and so on. Once you do this, hand over the margin money to the broker,
            who will then get in touch with the exchange. The exchange will find 
            you a seller (if you are a buyer) or a buyer (if you are seller).</p></strong>

      <strong><p>There are many advantages of trading in futures and options. 
        Futures and Options(F&O) contracts have hedging, arbitrage and
         leverage benefits. Arbitrage: Arbitrage implies taking advantage 
         of price differences in the same or similar financial instruments. 
         Hedging: The most common use of derivatives trading is hedging. It’s
          possible to use Futures and Options(F&O) contracts to set up a trading
           strategy in which a loss for one investment is mitigated or offset 
           by a gain in a comparable derivative. Margin trade: While trading 
           in the derivatives market, you only pay a margin. This is because 
           the actual value of the contracts would be too large in lakhs and 
           crores. However, when you make a profit, the percentage of growth 
           is exponentially higher. This allows you to make more money.</p></strong>
